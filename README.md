# Portfolio Website Project

This is the final project for my **Frontend Development** course. It is a personal portfolio website, designed and developed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a frontend developer.

## Key Features

1. **Built with React**:
   - Utilized React's component-based architecture for clean and modular code.
   - Implemented essential React hooks such as:
     - `useState` for managing state.
     - `useEffect` for handling side effects.
     - `useContext` and `useTheme` to manage themes and shared application context.

2. **Styling**:
   - The website is styled entirely with **pure CSS** for responsiveness and visual appeal.
   - The layout ensures compatibility across different screen sizes and devices.

3. **Modern Design**:
   - The design features a sleek, dark theme with professional typography and visual elements.
   - Includes links to social profiles (X, GitHub, LinkedIn) and a prominent "Resume" button for easy access.

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Dynamic user interactions implemented via React's state and effect hooks, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Purpose

This portfolio serves as a demonstration of my ability to build modern, responsive web applications using React and CSS. It highlights my journey through the course and showcases my understanding of React's fundamental concepts and practical application in creating functional and visually appealing user interfaces.
